# Lightstreamer - Portfolio Demo - Java Adapter
<!-- START DESCRIPTION lightstreamer-example-portfolio-adapter-java -->
The *Portfolio Demo* simulate a portfolio management: it shows a list of stocks included in a portfolio and provide a simple order entry form. Changes to portfolio contents, due to new orders, are displayed on the page in real time. In addition to that, the *Full Version of the Portfolio Demo* shows for each stock in the portfolio also the current price, updated in real time from a market data feed.

This project shows the Java Metadata and Data Adapters for the *Portfolio Demo* and how they can be plugged into Lightstreamer Server. It shows also how to integrate the [Lightstreamer - Stock-List Demo - Java Adapter](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-StockList-adapter-java) into the same Adapter Set to support the full version of the *Portfolio Demo*.   

As example of [Clients Using This Adapter](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-Portfolio-adapter-java#clients-using-this-adapter), you may refer to the [Basic Portfolio Demo - HTML Client](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-Portfolio-client-javascript#basic-portfolio-demo---html-client) and view the corresponding [Basic Portfolio Demo Live Demo](http://demos.lightstreamer.com/PortfolioDemo_Basic/) or you may refer to the [Portfolio Demo - HTML Client](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-Portfolio-client-javascript#portfolio-demo---html-client) and view the corresponding [Portfolio Demo Live Demo](http://demos.lightstreamer.com/PortfolioDemo/) for the full version of the *Portfolio Demo*.

## Details

### Dig the Code
The project is comprised of source code and a deployment example. The source code is divided into three folders.

#### Feed Simulator 
Contains the source code for a class that simulates a portfolio manager, which generates random portfolios and accepts buy and sell operations to change portfolio contents.

#### Portfolio DataAdapter
Contains the source code for the Basic Portfolio Demo Data Adapter, a demo Adapter that handles subscription requests by attaching to the simulated portfolio manager.
It can be referred to as a basic example for Data Adapter development.

#### Portfolio MetaDataAdapter
Contains the source code for a Metadata Adapter to be associated with the Portfolio Demo Data Adapter. This Metadata Adapter inherits from `LiteralBasedProvider` in [Lightstreamer - Reusable Metadata Adapters - Java Adapter](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-ReusableMetadata-adapter-java) and just adds a simple support for order entry by implementing the NotifyUserMessage method, in order to handle "sendMessage" requests from the Portfolio Demo client.
The communication to the Portfolio Feed Simulator, through the Portfolio Data Adapter, is handled here.

It should not be used as a reference for a real case of client-originated message handling, as no guaranteed delivery and no clustering support is shown.

See the source code comments for further details.

#### The Adapter Set Configuration

This Adapter Set is configured and will be referenced by the clients as `PORTFOLIODEMO`. 

The `adapters.xml` file for the Basic Portfolio Demo, should look like:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<!-- Mandatory. Define an Adapter Set and sets its unique ID. -->
<adapters_conf id="PORTFOLIODEMO">

    <!-- Mandatory. Define the Metadata Adapter. -->
    <metadata_provider>

        <!-- Mandatory. Java class name of the adapter. -->
        <adapter_class>portfolio_demo.adapters.PortfolioMetadataAdapter</adapter_class>

        <!-- Optional, managed by the inherited LiteralBasedProvider.
             See LiteralBasedProvider javadoc. -->
        <param name="item_family_1">portfolio.*</param>
        <param name="modes_for_item_family_1">COMMAND</param>

    </metadata_provider>

    <!-- Mandatory. Define the Data Adapter. -->
    <data_provider name="PORTFOLIO_ADAPTER">

        <!-- Mandatory. Java class name of the adapter. -->
        <adapter_class>portfolio_demo.adapters.PortfolioDataAdapter</adapter_class>

    </data_provider>

</adapters_conf>
```

The *full version of the Portfolio Demo* needs the Portfolio and the StockList demo adapters together in the same Adapter Set. 

The `adapters.xml` file for the Portfolio Demo, should look like:
```xml 
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<!-- Mandatory. Define an Adapter Set and sets its unique ID. -->
  <adapters_conf id="FULLPORTFOLIODEMO">

    <!-- Mandatory. Define the Metadata Adapter. -->
    <metadata_provider>

      <install_dir>portfolio</install_dir>

      <!-- Mandatory. Java class name of the adapter. -->
      <adapter_class>portfolio_demo.adapters.PortfolioMetadataAdapter</adapter_class>

      <!-- Optional, managed by the inherited LiteralBasedProvider.
           See LiteralBasedProvider javadoc. -->
      <param name="item_family_1">portfolio.*</param>
      <param name="modes_for_item_family_1">COMMAND</param>

      <param name="item_family_2">item.*</param>
      <param name="modes_for_item_family_2">MERGE</param>

    </metadata_provider>

    <!-- Mandatory. Define the Data Adapter. -->
    <data_provider name="PORTFOLIO_ADAPTER">

      <install_dir>portfolio</install_dir>

      <!-- Mandatory. Java class name of the adapter. -->
      <adapter_class>portfolio_demo.adapters.PortfolioDataAdapter</adapter_class>

    </data_provider>

    <!-- Mandatory. Define the Data Adapter. -->
    <data_provider name="QUOTE_ADAPTER">

      <install_dir>Stocklist</install_dir>

      <!-- Mandatory. Java class name of the adapter. -->
      <adapter_class>stocklist_demo.adapters.StockQuotesDataAdapter</adapter_class>

    </data_provider>

  </adapters_conf>
```

## Install

### Install the Basic Portfolio Demo
If you want to install a basic version of the *Portfolio Demo* in your local Lightstreamer Server, follow these steps.
* Download *Lightstreamer Server* (Lightstreamer Server comes with a free non-expiring demo license for 20 connected users) from [Lightstreamer Download page](http://www.lightstreamer.com/download.htm), and install it, as explained in the `GETTING_STARTED.TXT` file in the installation home directory.
* Make sure that Lightstreamer Server is not running.
* In the `adapters` folder of your Lightstreamer Server installation you may find a `Demo` folder, containing some adapters ready-made for several demo including the Portfolio one. If this is the case, you have allready a Portfolio Demo Adapter installed and you may stop here. Please note that, in case of Demo folder already installed, the MetaData Adapter jar installed is a mixed one that combines the functionality of several demos. If the Demo folder is not installed or you have removed it or you want to install the Portfolio Adapter Set alone, please continue to follow the next steps.
* Get the `deploy.zip` file of the [latest release](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-Portfolio-adapter-java/releases), unzip it, go to the `Deployment_LS` folder and copy the `Portfolio` folder into the `adapters` folder of your Lightstreamer Server installation.
* Launch Lightstreamer Server.
* Test the Adapter, launching the [Basic Portfolio Demo - HTML Client](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-Portfolio-client-javascript#basic-portfolio-demo---html-client), listed in [Clients Using This Adapter](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-Portfolio-adapter-java#clients-using-this-adapter).

### Install the Portfolio Demo
To work with fully functionality, the [Portfolio Demo - HTML Client](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-Portfolio-client-javascript#portfolio-demo---html-client), needs both the *PORTFOLIO_ADAPTER*, from the *Portfolio Demo*, and the *QUOTE_ADAPTER*, from the *Stock-List Demo* (see [Lightstreamer - Stock-List Demo - Java Adapter](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-StockList-adapter-java)). 
If you want to install a full version of the *Portfolio Demo* in your local Lightstreamer Server, you have to deploy the *PORTFOLIO_ADAPTER* and the *QUOTE_ADAPTER* together in the same Adapter Set. 
To allow the two adapters to coexist within the same Adapter Set, please follow the steps below.
* Download *Lightstreamer Server* (Lightstreamer Server comes with a free non-expiring demo license for 20 connected users) from [Lightstreamer Download page](http://www.lightstreamer.com/download.htm), and install it, as explained in the `GETTING_STARTED.TXT` file in the installation home directory.
* Make sure that Lightstreamer Server is not running.
* In the `adapters` folder of your Lightstreamer Server installation you may find a `Demo` folder, containing some adapters ready-made for several demo including the Portfolio one. If this is the case, you have allready a Portfolio Demo Adapter installed and you may stop here. Please note that, in case of Demo folder already installed, the MetaData Adapter jar installed is a mixed one that combines the functionality of several demos. If the Demo folder is not installed or you have removed it or you want to install the Portfolio Adapter Set alone, please continue to follow the next steps.
* Get the `deploy.zip` file of the [latest release](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-Portfolio-adapter-java/releases), unzip it, go to the `Full_Deployment_LS` folder and copy the `FullPortfolio` folder into the `adapters` folder of your Lightstreamer Server installation.
* Launch Lightstreamer Server.
* Test the Adapter, launching the [Portfolio Demo - HTML Client](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-Portfolio-client-javascript#portfolio-demo---html-client), listed in [Clients Using This Adapter](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-Portfolio-adapter-java#clients-using-this-adapter).

## Build
To build your own version of `LS_portfolio_feed_simulator.jar`, `LS_portfolio_data_adapter.jar` and `LS_portfolio_metadata_adapter.jar`, instead of using the one provided in the `deploy.zip` file from the [Install](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-Portfolio-adapter-java#install) section above, follow these steps.
* Download this project.
*  Get the `ls-adapter-interface.jar`, `ls-generic-adapters.jar`, and `log4j-1.2.15.jar` files from the [latest Lightstreamer distribution](http://www.lightstreamer.com/download), and copy them into the `lib` directory.
* Create the jars LS_portfolio_metadata_adapter.jar, LS_portfolio_feed_simulator.jar, and LS_portfolio_data_adapter.jar created by something like these commands
```sh
 >javac -source 1.7 -target 1.7 -nowarn -g -classpath compile_libs/log4j-1.2.15.jar -sourcepath src/src_feed -d tmp_classes src/src_feed/portfolio_demo/feed_simulator/Portfolio.java
 
 >jar cvf LS_portfolio_feed_simulator.jar -C tmp_classes src_feed
 
 >javac -source 1.7 -target 1.7 -nowarn -g -classpath compile_libs/log4j-1.2.15.jar;compile_libs/ls-adapter-interface/ls-adapter-interface.jar;compile_libs/ls-generic-adapters/ls-generic-adapters.jar;LS_portfolio_feed_simulator.jar -sourcepath src/src_portfolio -d tmp_classes src/src_portfolio/portfolio_demo/adapters/PortfolioDataAdapter.java
 
 >jar cvf LS_portfolio_data_adapter.jar -C tmp_classes src_portfolio
 
 >javac -source 1.7 -target 1.7 -nowarn -g -classpath compile_libs/log4j-1.2.15.jar;compile_libs/ls-adapter-interface/ls-adapter-interface.jar;compile_libs/ls-generic-adapters/ls-generic-adapters.jar;LS_portfolio_feed_simulator.jar;LS_portfolio_data_adapter.jar -sourcepath src/src_metadata -d tmp_classes src/src_metadata/portfolio_demo/adapters/PortfolioMetadataAdapter.java
 
 >jar cvf LS_portfolio_metadata_adapter.jar -C tmp_classes src_metadata
```
* copy the just compiled `LS_portfolio_feed_simulator.jar`, `LS_portfolio_data_adapter.jar` and `LS_portfolio_metadata_adapter.jar` in the `adapters/Portfolio/lib` or `adapters/FullPortfolio/Portfolio/lib` folder of your Lightstreamer Server installation.
